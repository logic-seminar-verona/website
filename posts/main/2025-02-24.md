_A topos-theoretic perspective on completions of doctrines_

Lawvere doctrines are an intuitive extension of Lindenbaum-Tarski algebras from propositional logic to predicate logic, where the role of logical quantifiers is captured by a pair of adjoint functions. 

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the field of ‘completing’ doctrines to richer syntax, e.g. Trotta’s existential completion.  We will describe a topos-theoretic framework for completing doctrines to subfragments of geometric logic.
