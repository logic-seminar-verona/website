**Abstract:** Martin-Löf’s type theory (MLTT) is a predicative modification of lambda-calculus with many applications to the theory of programming languages. The recent extension of MLTT with the axiom of univalence (UA) by the late Fields medalist Voevodsky reveals surprising connections between homotopy theory and logic. Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) can be described as MLTT + UA + Higher Inductive Types. HoTT and Category Theory (CaT), are currently among the most actively studied mathematical frameworks for the logical foundations of mathematics and theoretical computer science. The following topics are planned to be covered: introduction to MLTT, function-extensionality axiom, the groupoid model of Hofmann and Streicher, Voevodsky’s axiom of univalence, homotopy n-types, higher inductive types, the fundamental group of the higher circle, relations between HoTT and constructive mathematics, relations between HoTT and CaT. 

**No prior knowledge of homotopy theory and type theory is required.**

**Lecture notes will be available.**
