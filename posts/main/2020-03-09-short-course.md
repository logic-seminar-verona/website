title: Compact Course "Category theory and point-free topology"
---

The course will take place on March 9-27, 2020. Timetable below.

**Category theory and point-free topology**

The Short Course "Category Theory and Point-Free Topology" is primarily
aimed at both undergraduate and postgraduate students in mathematics
with an interest in the intersection between logic, algebra and
topology. The event will take place at the Department of Computer
Science of the University of Verona, located in Strada le Grazie 15,
Verona (Italy).

**Summary**\
"Point-free topology" is the theory of "locales". They are a type of
spaces, very similar to topological spaces, except that they might not
have an underlying set of points. Locales that have enough points are
the same as topological spaces, but some locales have no points and are
completely new objects. We will see how many notions and constructions
of ordinary topology carry over to locales. Later in the course I will
talk about the internal logic of categories of sheaves, which provide an
extremely powerful tool to work with locales. I will explain how these
mysterious "spaces without points" are closely connected to 'forcing' in
set theory, as well as the strong connection between the the theory of
locales and intuitionistic mathematics. The course will start with a
basic introduction to category theory, including limits and co-limits,
epi and monomorphisms, adjoint functors and adjoint functor theorem,
etc. The theory of locales will give many illustrations and interesting
example of these concepts.
