**Modal Logics and Intuitionistic Logic**\
[Stefania Centrone](https://www.philosophie.tu-berlin.de/menue/fachgebiete/theoretische_philosophie/priv_doz_dr_stefania_centrone/) (TU Berlin)

The minicourse "Modal logics and intuitionistic logic" (12h) has been videoregistered in August 2020. Members of the University of Verona who wish to follow the course but are not authorised to access [this link](https://moodledidattica.univr.it/course/view.php?id=4217#section-4) are kindly asked to contact [Giulio Fellin](https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=40478&lang=it).

_Abstract_\
Modal logics capture concepts of necessity and possibility; 
intuitionistic logic models computation and construction. This 
minicourse is intended to introduce into both kinds of logic with 
particular attention on their interaction, from the angles of syntax
and semantics but with a certain proof-theoretic flavour. One
highlight will be GÃ¶del's embedding of intuitionistic propositional
logic into the modal logic S4, which stood at the beginning of
provability logic.
