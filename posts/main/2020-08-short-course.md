**Modal Logics and Intuitionistic Logic**\
[Stefania Centrone](https://www.philosophie.tu-berlin.de/menue/fachgebiete/theoretische_philosophie/priv_doz_dr_stefania_centrone/) (TU Berlin)

_Abstract_\
Modal logics capture concepts of necessity and possibility; 
intuitionistic logic models computation and construction. This 
minicourse is intended to introduce into both kinds of logic with 
particular attention on their interaction, from the angles of syntax
and semantics but with a certain proof-theoretic flavour. One
highlight will be GÃ¶del's embedding of intuitionistic propositional
logic into the modal logic S4, which stood at the beginning of
provability logic.

This short course (12h) will be recorded by August 2020 and be made available as soon as possible.
