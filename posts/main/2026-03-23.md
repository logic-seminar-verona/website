_Abstract_\
After a reminder of the key concepts and methods of constructive/computational algebra,
this course will aim at generalised Buchberger and Schreyer algorithms for coherent rings. Chapter 1
focuses on the concept of Gröbner bases over a field as a powerful tool for problem solving in algebraic
geometry. In contrast to typical treatments of Gröbner bases, we give in Chapter 2 a theory of Gröbner
bases in the broader framework of coherent arithmetical rings (possibly with nonzero zero-divisors)
and, more generally in Chapter 3, over coherent strongly discrete rings. Notably, for any finitely
generated submodule M of a free module over a multivariate polynomial ring with coefficients in a
discrete coherent ring, we prove that its module LT(M) of leading terms is countably generated, and
provide an algorithm for computing explicitly a generating set. This result is also useful when LT(M) is
not finitely generated. We further give a general constructive version of Hilbert’s syzygy theorem over
strongly discrete coherent rings, following Schreyer's method.
