_Priority method over intuitionistic logic_

In this talk, we consider how much non-constructive principles are sufficient for Friedberg-Muchinik construction of degree d such that 0<d<0'. 
We will see that the only point we need a non-constructive principle is to show 
"if a recursive set S of natural number has finite cardinality, then S has an upper bound", 
which requires \Sigma^0_1 law of excluded middle.
