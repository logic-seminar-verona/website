_Sheaf models and constructive mathematics_

*Abstract:* 

Sheaf models over sites, introduced by Grothendieck in algebraic geometry, are also important in the meta-theory of intuitionistic mathematics for showing that some properties are not valid constructively or for providing models of the notion of choice sequences. In this talk, I would like to explain another use of sheaf models in constructive mathematics, suggested by Joyal in 1975, which is to provide a way to build an algebraic closure of an arbitrary field.

The seminar will be held on Zoom. In order to get access to the Zoom meeting, please contact [Peter Schuster](http://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=21404&lang=en) or [Giulio Fellin](https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=40478).
