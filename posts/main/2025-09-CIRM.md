**Synthetic mathematics, logic-affine computation and efficient proof systems**

CIRM - Centre International de Rencontres Math√©matiques, Marseille Luminy, France, 8-12 September 2025.

Synthetic frameworks have proved to be pivotal tools at the interface of mathematics and informatics, especially enabling concise formalizations and custom proof systems. Noteworthy achievements include homotopy type theory, synthetic computability theory, and synthetic algebraic geometry. Very similar paradigms characterize the related areas of logic-driven computational algebra and geometry, sheaf models and modern realizability theory, and strong negation for constructive reasoning with negative information. Contrasting yet complementary approaches are about to converge, emphasizing the imperative of unifying theoretical underpinnings with practical implementation. With the proposed seminar we aim to extend and deepen the convergence across disciplinary boundaries by fostering exchange and collaboration among experts and practitioners.
