_Universal Algebra in UniMath_ (joint work with Marco Maggesi and Cosimo Perini Brogi)

*Abstract:* 

In this talk we will report on recent experiments in implementing the basic notions of universal algebra in the Unimath library. Unimath is a replacement of the standard library of the Coq proof assistant based on the univalent foundations of mathematics. Since the use of general higher order inductive types is forbidden in Unimath, a relevant part of this work has been the implementation of terms as lists of function symbols in such a way that the operations on terms are computable by the standard Coq evaluation mechanism.

More information can be found in the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05952).

The seminar will be held on Zoom. In order to get access to the Zoom meeting, please contact [Peter Schuster](http://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=21404&lang=en) or [Giulio Fellin](https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=40478).
