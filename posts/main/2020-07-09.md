_Hilbert $\epsilon$-operator and existence property in categorical logic_ (j.w.w. M. Zorzi and M.E. Maietti)

*Abstract:* 

In this talk we present some choice principles in the context of categorical logic and their applications in logic. In particular we focus on the existence property, the choice rule and the Hilbert $\epsilon$-operator. We use the language of doctrines and the existential completion to present these principles and their characterization. Then we provide some direct applications in a fragment of intuitionistic logic.

The seminar will be held on Zoom. In order to get access to the Zoom meeting, please contact [Peter Schuster](http://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=21404&lang=en).
