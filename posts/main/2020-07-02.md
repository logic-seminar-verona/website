[Gianluigi Bellin](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~bellin/) (Universit√† di Verona)\
_Relational sequent calculusl for Bi-Intuitionistiic Linear Logic_ (j.w.w. W. Heijltjes)

*Abstract:* The relational sequent calculus for BILL used in [Bellin & Heijltjes, {Proof nets for
bi-intuitionistic linear logic}, FSCD 2018] is unsound. The problem extends to
Hyland and De Paiva Full Iintuitionistic Linear Logic FILL 1993, but only to the
treatment of the unit $\bot$, as shown by an example of failure of interpolation
in the sequent calculus, which yields unsoundness with respect to Hyland and De Paiva's
categorical semantics. We revise the sequent calculus, sketch the proof of interpolation
and of cut elimination for it.


The seminar will be held on Zoom. In order to get access to the Zoom meeting, please contact [Peter Schuster](http://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=21404&lang=en).
