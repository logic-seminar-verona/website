<em>Two-level type theory</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>Homotopy type theory (HoTT) extends Martin-Löf type theory with the univalence axiom, which establishes a tight connection between types and homotopy spaces and allows to identify isomorphic objects. Univalence has very useful applications, but it has also drawbacks: properties that are not invariant under homotopy cannot be expressed internally. An important case is the concept of semisimplicial types, whose definition is so far elusive in HoTT. Two-level type theory (2LTT) is a formal theory which allows constructions that require access to non-homotopy-invariant notions. It is composed of two separate levels of types related by a conversion function that preserves context extensions; the outer level is Martin-Löf type theory plus the uniqueness of identity proofs, and the inner level is HoTT. In this talk we will discuss the consequences of univalence, and introduce 2LTT as a way to overcome some difficulties. Then, we will introduce the notion of model for this system, and define the syntactical category as a first step to prove an initiality result for the syntax of 2LTT. The last part of the talk is based on a joint work-in-progress with Benedikt Ahrens and Nicolai Kraus.</p>
<p>The seminar will be held on Zoom. In order to get access to the Zoom meeting, please contact <a href="http://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&amp;id=21404&amp;lang=en">Peter Schuster</a> or <a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&amp;id=40478">Giulio Fellin</a>.</p>

<em>Universal Algebra in UniMath</em> (joint work with Marco Maggesi and Cosimo Perini Brogi)</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>In this talk we will report on recent experiments in implementing the basic notions of universal algebra in the Unimath library. Unimath is a replacement of the standard library of the Coq proof assistant based on the univalent foundations of mathematics. Since the use of general higher order inductive types is forbidden in Unimath, a relevant part of this work has been the implementation of terms as lists of function symbols in such a way that the operations on terms are computable by the standard Coq evaluation mechanism.</p>

<em>Sheaf models and constructive mathematics</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>Sheaf models over sites, introduced by Grothendieck in algebraic geometry, are also important in the meta-theory of intuitionistic mathematics for showing that some properties are not valid constructively or for providing models of the notion of choice sequences. In this talk, I would like to explain another use of sheaf models in constructive mathematics, suggested by Joyal in 1975, which is to provide a way to build an algebraic closure of an arbitrary field.</p>

<em>The Yoneda Reduction of Polymorphic Types (joint work with Luca Tranchini)</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>We explore a family of type isomorphisms in System F whose validity corresponds, semantically, to some form of the Yoneda isomorphism from category theory. These isomorphisms hold under theories of equivalence stronger than βη-equivalence, like those induced by parametricity and dinaturality. Based on such isomorphisms, we investigate a rewriting over types, that we call Yoneda reduction, which can be used to eliminate quantifiers from a polymorphic type, replacing them with a combination of monomorphic type constructors. We then demonstrate some applications of this rewriting to problems like counting the inhabitants of a type or characterizing program equivalence in some fragments of System F.</p>

<em>FULL CUT ELIMINATION AND INTERPOLATION FOR INTUITIONISTIC LOGIC WITH EXISTENCE PREDICATE</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>In previous work by Baaz and Iemhoff, a Gentzen calculus for intuitionistic logic with existence predicate is presented that satisfies partial cut elimination and Craig’s interpolation property; it is also conjectured that interpolation fails for the implication-free fragment. In this paper an equivalent calculus is introduced that satisfies full cut elimination and allows a direct proof of interpolation via Maehara’s lemma. In this way, it is possible to obtain much simpler interpolants and to better understand and (partly) overcome the failure of interpolation for the implication-free fragment.</p>

<p>The minicourse “Modal logics and intuitionistic logic” (12h) has been videoregistered in August 2020. Members of the University of Verona who wish to follow the course but are not authorised to access <a href="https://moodledidattica.univr.it/course/view.php?id=4217#section-4">this link</a> are kindly asked to contact <a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&amp;id=40478&amp;lang=it">Giulio Fellin</a>.</p>
<p><em>Abstract</em><br />
Modal logics capture concepts of necessity and possibility; intuitionistic logic models computation and construction. This minicourse is intended to introduce into both kinds of logic with particular attention on their interaction, from the angles of syntax and semantics but with a certain proof-theoretic flavour. One highlight will be Gödel’s embedding of intuitionistic propositional logic into the modal logic S4, which stood at the beginning of provability logic.</p>

        <p><strong>The dynamical method in commutative algebra</strong><br />
Ihsen Yengui (Univ. Sfax, Tunisia)</p>
<p>The minicourse “The dynamical method in commutative algebra” (12h) has been videoregistered in August 2020. Members of the University of Verona who wish to follow the course but are not authorised to access <a href="https://moodledidattica.univr.it/mod/page/view.php?id=168536">this link</a> are kindly asked to contact <a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&amp;id=40478&amp;lang=it">Giulio Fellin</a>.</p>
<p><em>Abstract</em><br />
Transfinite methods, typically in the form of a variant of Zorn’s Lemma, are frequently invoked during proofs in commutative algebra. Dynamical methods have proved practicable to still render constructive proofs of that kind. Roughly speaking, ideal objects such as prime ideals are approximated by paths in finite trees which are grown as the proofs in question demand and carry the information required for the desired computation.</p>

<em>Elementary doctrines as coalgebras</em> (j.w.w. Fabio Pasquali and Pino Rosolini)</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>Lawvere’s hyperdoctrines mark the beginning of applications of category theory to logic. The connection between (typed) logical theories and certain functors taking values in the category of posets is exemplified by two embeddings: of elementary doctrines into primary ones, and of elementary doctrines with effective quotients into elementary ones. In logical terms these correspond to the inclusion of <span class="math inline"><em>Λ</em><sub>=</sub></span>-theories into <span class="math inline"><em>Λ</em></span>-theories, resp. of <span class="math inline"><em>Λ</em><sub>=</sub></span>-theories with quotients into <span class="math inline"><em>Λ</em><sub>=</sub></span>-theories. Each of the two inclusions is part of an adjunction whose right, resp. left, functor adds quotients for equivalence relations. After discussing the above adjunctions and their connection to logic and type theory, I shall present a recent result, obtained with Fabio Pasquali and Pino Rosolini, showing that the first embedding is 2-comonadic. Finally, if time allows, I shall delve into the connections to model theory and discuss how the comonadic adjuntion provides an algebraic description of Shelah’s construction of a theory that eliminates imaginaries from classical model theory. The talk is based on the paper E., Pasquali, Rosolini. Elementary doctrines as coalgebras. J. Pure Appl. Algebra 224, 2020. doi:10.1016/j.jpaa.2020.106445</p>

<a href="http://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&amp;id=126&amp;lang=it">Andrea Masini</a> (Università di Verona)</p>
<p><em>Program</em><br />
1) Recalls of natural deduction (classical and intuitionist) and of typed lambda calculus.<br />
2) Examples of simple proofs in Coq (Goal, Assumptions and Tactics).<br />
3) Functional programming in CoQ.<br />
4) Structured data types.<br />
5) Polymorphism and higher order functions.<br />
6) The basic tactics.<br />
7) Logic in CoQ.<br />
8) Induction</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in a course of only 12 hours, even if intensive, it will not be possible to tackle the applications of COQ, which range from the specification and proof of properties of complex computer systems (SW and HW) to the mechanisation of mathematics (continuous and discrete).</p>
<p><em>Timetable</em><br />
Wednesday 9 September 2020, at [10.00-13.00]<br />
Thursday 10 September 2020, at [10.00-13.00]<br />
Wednesday 16 September 2020, at [10.00-13.00]<br />
Thursday 17 September 2020, at [10.00-13.00]</p>
<p>The course is open to everyone, the only pre-requisite is to have the basic knowledge of logic.</p>
<p>It is still not clear whether the course will be held in presence or on-line. We’re waiting for precise indications from the doctoral school.</p>
