<em>Relational sequent calculusl for Bi-Intuitionistiic Linear Logic</em> (j.w.w. W. Heijltjes)</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> The relational sequent calculus for BILL used in [Bellin &amp; Heijltjes, {Proof nets for bi-intuitionistic linear logic}, FSCD 2018] is unsound. The problem extends to Hyland and De Paiva Full Iintuitionistic Linear Logic FILL 1993, but only to the treatment of the unit <span class="math inline">⊥</span>, as shown by an example of failure of interpolation in the sequent calculus, which yields unsoundness with respect to Hyland and De Paiva’s categorical semantics. We revise the sequent calculus, sketch the proof of interpolation and of cut elimination for it.</p>

<em>Proof-terms for dual-intuitionistic logic and refutation-terms for intuitionistic logic</em> (j.w.w. Gianluigi Bellin)</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>In the present paper, we present a term-assignment for the fragment of bi-intuitionistic logic whose only type-forming operation is the dual of intuitionistic implication. Typing judgements have the form x:C |- t_1:A_1,…,t_n:A_n i.e. a set of terms is typed by declaring a single variable (somewhat dualizing the simply typed λ-calculus, where a single term is typed declaring a set of variables). The main distinguishing feature of our term calculus is its distributed nature: whereas in the λμ-calculus all conclusions but one are μ-variables, in our calculus the computational content is distributed among the conclusions, i.e. to each conclusion one assigns a possibly complex term; moreover, reduction is also distributed, in the sense that the reduction acts globally on a set of terms, and not on a single one. The duality between our calculus and the simply typed λ-calculus suggests the possibility to use it not only to encode the dual-intuitionistic notion of provability, but an intuitionistic notion of refutability as well. We spell out this idea by using our terms to decorate Prawitz’s rules of intuitionistic natural deduction from the bottom to the top, thereby expressing a backwards reading of intuitionistic rules: given refutations of the conclusions one computes refutations of the premises.</p>

<em>Intuitionistic mereology</em> (j.w.w. A. Varzi)</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>Like any formal theory, mereology consists of axioms concerning the propositional connectives and quantifiers (logical axioms) and axioms concerning the parthood relation (proper axioms). Over the years, philosophical reasons have motivated interest in departing from the traditional axiomatization of mereology. Proper axioms such as the principle of strong supplementation or the principle of unrestricted composition have been weakened or rejected altogether and even elementary axioms like the anti-symmetry of parthood or its transitivity are no longer regarded as uncontentious. Logical axioms have been challenged, too. For example, many-valued logic, free logic and plural quantification have long been considered as sensible alternatives to classical first-order logic and, more recently, mereological theories based on paraconsistent logic have also been proposed. The two kinds of revisions are normally seen as independent from each other, but this isn’t always the case. For instance, I will show that developing an intuitionistic mereology by rejecting the law of excluded middle without touching the proper axioms would fails to validate nearly all the compelling principles of extensionality. If, one the other hand, the logical revision (from classical to intuitionistic logic) is accompanied by a suitable revision of the proper axioms, extensionality can be fully recovered. I will also show that change of the proper axioms can easily be made if the traditional mereological primitives are defined in terms of notions that have been investigated in constructive mathematics, mainly (though not exclusively) the notion of apartness (Brouwer, Heyting) and excess (von Plato).</p>

<em>Extensions of paraconsistent weak Kleene logic</em> (j.w.w. F. Paoli)</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>Paraconsistent Weak Kleene Logic (PWK) is the 3-valued logic based on the weak Kleene matrices and with two designated values. In this paper, we investigate the poset of prevarieties of generalised involutive bisemilattices, focussing in particular on the order ideal generated by Alg(PWK). Applying to this poset a general result by Alexej Pynko, we prove that, apart from classical logic, the only proper nontrivial extension of PWK is its maximally structurally incomplete companion: PWK_E, Paraconsistent Weak Kleene Logic plus Explosion. We describe its consequence relation via a variable-inclusion criterion and identify its Suszko reduced models.</p>

<em>Compositional theories for embedded programming</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>Embedded programming style allows to split the syntax in two parts, representing respectively a host language H and a core language C embedded in H. This formally models several situations in which a user writes code in a main language and delegates some tasks to an ad hoc domain specific language. Moreover, as showed in recent years, a particular case of the host-core approach allows a flexible management of data linearity, which is particularly useful in non-classical computational paradigms such as quantum computing.<br />
The definition of a systematised type theory to capture and standardize common properties of embedded languages is partially unexplored. We present a flexible fragment of such a type theory, together with its semantics in terms of enriched categories.<br />
We introduce the calculus HC0 and we use the notion of internal language of a category to relate the language to the class of its models, showing the equivalence between the category of models and the one of theories. This provides a stronger result w.r.t. standard soundness and completeness since it involves not only the models but also morphisms between models. We observe that the definition of the morphisms between models highlights further advantages of the embedded languages and we discuss some concrete instances, extensions and specializations of the syntax and the semantics.</p>

<em>Logic in Railway Verification</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract</em>: Mathematical methods always played an important role in the verification of Railway control systems. In this talk we present two different approaches, the first for discrete systems, the second for hybrid systems. Both were used in our collaboration with Industry. We start with traditional solid state Railway interlockings, often specified using a graphical language called Ladder Logic. We give a semantics for this language and show how to get from aladder logic specification to a satisfiability problem. This process has been automated, and several existing Interlocking case studies, provided by our Industrial partner Siemens Rail Automation, have been verified using automated theorem proving tools. We further applied our own SAT solver, which we extracted from a formal constructive proof of the completeness of the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) proof system. The extracted SAT solver is a verified algorithm, which either yields a model or a DPLL refutation of a given clause set [1]. In the second part, we present our modelling of the European Rail Traffic Management System ERTMS, a state-of-the-art train control system, which aims at improving the performance/capacity of rail traffic systems, without compromising their safety. It generalizes from traditional interlockings to a system that includes on-board equipment and communication between trains and interlockings via radio block processors. Whilst the correctness of discrete interlocking systems is well-researched, it is challenging to verify ERTMS based systems for safety properties such as collision freedom due to the involvement of continuous data. The modelling and verification is done in Real-Time Maude, a tool that allows for both simulation and verification of real-time and hybrid systems [2].</p>

<em>Modal Logic for Induction</em> (j.w.w. Sara Negri and Peter Schuster)</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> We use modal logic to obtain syntactical, proof-theoretic versions of transfinite induction as axioms or rules within an appropriate labelled sequent calculus. While transfinite induction proper, also known as Noetherian induction, can be represented by a rule, the variant in which induction is done up to an arbitrary but fixed level happens to correspond to the Gödel–Löb axiom of provability logic. To verify the practicability of our approach in actual practice, we give a fairly universal pattern for proof transformation and test its use in several cases. Among other things, we give a direct and elementary syntactical proof of the theorem that the Gödel–Löb axiom characterises precisely the well-founded and transitive Kripke frames.</p>

<p>The course will take place on March 9-27, 2020. Timetable below.</p>
<p><strong>Category theory and point-free topology</strong></p>
<p>The Compact Course “Category Theory and Point-Free Topology” is primarily aimed at both undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students in mathematics with an interest in the intersection between logic, algebra and topology. The event will take place at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Verona, located in Strada le Grazie 15, Verona (Italy).</p>
<p><strong>Lecturer</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.normalesup.org/~henry/">Simon Henry</a> (University of Ottawa)</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
“Point-free topology” is the theory of “locales”. They are a type of spaces, very similar to topological spaces, except that they might not have an underlying set of points. Locales that have enough points are the same as topological spaces, but some locales have no points and are completely new objects. We will see how many notions and constructions of ordinary topology carry over to locales. Later in the course I will talk about the internal logic of categories of sheaves, which provide an extremely powerful tool to work with locales. I will explain how these mysterious “spaces without points” are closely connected to ‘forcing’ in set theory, as well as the strong connection between the the theory of locales and intuitionistic mathematics. The course will start with a basic introduction to category theory, including limits and co-limits, epi and monomorphisms, adjoint functors and adjoint functor theorem, etc. The theory of locales will give many illustrations and interesting example of these concepts.</p>
