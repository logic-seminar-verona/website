        <p><strong>Substructural Logics à la Lambek: Proof Theory and Categorical Semantics</strong><br />
<a href="https://cs.ioc.ee/~tarmo/">Tarmo Uustalu</a> (Reykjavik University &amp; Tallinn University of Technology)<br />
October 21–30, 2024</p>
<p><em>Abstract</em><br />
In the 1960s, Joachim Lambek pioneered an approach to substructural logics that unifies proof theory and category theory, motivated by linguistics. ‘Substructural’ means here that some basic principles like “A implies true,” “A implies A and A,” and “A and B imply B and A” do not hold. In sequent calculus terms, this corresponds to the absence of the structural rules of left weakening, contraction, and exchange, indicating that logic is more about resources than truth. What is now known as Lambek calculus is a noncommutative intuitionistic linear logic with a (multiplicative) conjunction and two implications, left and right.<br />
In this minicourse, I will review this approach first on Lambek calculus and a number of variations of it. Then I will focus on skew logics—logics that are even weaker than substructural in that the conjunction connective is only semiunital and semiassociative.<br />
The course will be self-contained. Basic knowledge of classical and intuitionistic logic (Hilbert-style systems and sequent calculi) is desirable for good intuitions. I will introduce the necessary ingredients of proof theory and category theory.</p>

<p><em>Monadic second order limit laws for natural well orderings</em></p>
<p>We prove monadic second order limit laws for ordinals stemming from segments of some prominent proof-theoretic ordinals like ωω , ε0, Γ0, . . . . The results are based on a combination of automata theoretic results, tree enumeration theory and Tauberian methods. We believe that our results will hold in very general contexts.</p>
<p>Some results have been obtained jointly with Alan R. Woods (who unfortunately passed away in 2011).</p>

<p><em>Reverse Mathematics of WQO’s of Transfinite Sequences with Finite Range</em></p>
<p>In this talk I will present the result about the provability in ATR_0 of the theorem of Nash-Williams that sequences with finite range over a wqo form a wqo. For this we develop a framework where we work with α-wqo’s over primitive recursive set theory extended with a global enumeration function and then transfer the results obtained there to ATR_0.</p>
<p>The talk is based on a research project joint with Giovanni Soldà.</p>

<p><em>The Intentum and Intentic Models</em></p>
<p>I will present the main ideas of a research proposal in the making. It aims to develop a dynamic (potentialist) account of an agent’s first-order intentional attitudes as representative models of (possible) reality. The account introduces the new notion of the intentum, and formally develops intentic models consisting of such intenta. These are meant to be structures that an agent can dynamically construct mentally, and which consequently help us philosophically explain and reason about beliefs, wishes, imaginations, etc. Here follow some promising applications of this framework:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It offers a novel theory of propositions and intentionality, somewhat in the spirit of Frege, but with distinct advantages compared to the two classical accounts of Frege and Russell.</p></li>
<li><p>It provides a foundational approach of value to the fragmented field of theoretical research on AI agenthood.</p></li>
<li><p>It enables a modular account of the notoriously complex notion of reference.</p></li>
<li><p>It provides a lens for approaching philosophical questions about identity.</p></li>
<li><p>It helps to philosophically explain knowledge of mathematics.</p></li>
<li><p>It provides a modern formal basis for the Kantian theory of categories, with a particular application to mathematical induction (as “synthetic a priori” knowledge).</p></li>
<li><p>It sheds light on arbitrary objects.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In my talk, I will explain the basic ideas of the framework and explain a select few of these applications.</p>

<p><em>Subintuitionistic logics and their modal companions: a nested approach</em></p>
<p>In the present talk we deal with subintuitionistic logics and their modal companions. In particular, we introduce nested calculi for subintuitionistic systems and for modal logics in the S5 modal cube ranging from K to S4. The latter calculi differ from standard nested systems, as there are multiple rules handling the modal operator. As an upshot, we get a purely syntactic proof of the Gödel–McKinsey–Tarski embedding which preserves the structure and the height of the derivations. Finally, we obtain a conservativity result for classical logic over a weak subintuitionistic system.</p>

<p><em>Modal logic for induction: from chain conditions to arithmetic</em></p>
<p>j.w.w. S. Negri and P. Schuster</p>
<p>We use modal logic to obtain syntactical, proof-theoretic versions of transfinite induction as axioms or rules within an appropriate labelled sequent calculus. While transfinite induction proper, also known as Noetherian induction, can be represented by a rule, the variant in which induction is done up to an arbitrary but fixed level happens to correspond to the Gödel–Löb axiom of provability logic. To verify the practicability of our approach in actual practice, we sketch a fairly universal pattern for proof transformation and test its use in several cases. Among other things, we give a direct and elementary syntactical proof of Segerberg’s theorem that the Gödel–Löb axiom characterises precisely the (converse) well-founded and transitive Kripke frames. We then show that, by adding appropriate rules, this approach allows us to obtain a calculus for a bounded version of Peano Arithmetic. Finally, we observe that, by slightly modifying the rules, we can do the same for arithmetic in ordinals other than ω.</p>

<p><em>Epistemic Ensembles</em></p>
<p>in cooperation with A. Knapp (Univ. of Augsburg)
and M. Wirsing (LMU Munich)</p>
<p>An ensemble is formed by a collection of agents which
run concurrently to accomplish (together) a certain task.
For that purpose agents must collaborate in some way,
for instance by explicit interaction via message passing.
In this talk we present an epistemic approach where
collaboration is based on the knowledge that agents have
about themselves, about other agents and about their
environment. Any change of knowledge caused by an action
of one agent may influence the behaviour of other agents.
Hence, interaction is implicit.</p>
<p>For specifying properties of epistemic ensembles we propose
a dynamic logic style such that necessary and possible
ensemble behaviours are expressed by modalities on (complex)
epistemic actions. Our semantic models are labelled transition
systems with ensemble actions as labels. Such transitions
model two aspects, (i) the control flow of an ensemble and
(ii) changes of epistemic information caused by the epistemic
effect of an agent action.</p>
<p>Epistemic ensembles are implemented by epistemic processes,
one for each ensemble agent, which are composed in parallel
to form an ensemble realisations. We provide a structured
operational semantics for such processes which allows us to
introduce a (formal) correctness notion: An ensemble realisation
is correct w. r. t. an ensemble specification if its semantics
is an epistemic model of the specification. Two ensemble
realisations are equivalent, if their models are epistemically
bisimilar. We show that this can be checked by checking
bisimilarity of their single processes in the usual sense
of process algebra.</p>

<p><em>Implicative models of set theory</em></p>
<p>Implicative algebras were introduced by A.Miquel to provide a common foundation for Heyting/Boolean-valued logic and realizability. In this talk I will show how one can produce models for intuitionistic and classical Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (I)ZF using implicative algebras, generalizing forcing and realizability models for set theory, both intuitionistic and classical . This result has an application to the theory of toposes, since it entails that every topos which is obtained from Set by means of the tripos-to-topos construction contains a model of (I)ZF, provided one assumes a large enough inaccessible cardinal exists. This talk is based on a joint work with A.Miquel.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Martin-Löf’s type theory (MLTT) is a predicative modification of lambda-calculus with many applications to the theory of programming languages. The recent extension of MLTT with the axiom of univalence (UA) by the late Fields medalist Voevodsky reveals surprising connections between homotopy theory and logic. Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) can be described as MLTT + UA + Higher Inductive Types. HoTT and Category Theory (CaT), are currently among the most actively studied mathematical frameworks for the logical foundations of mathematics and theoretical computer science. The following topics are planned to be covered: introduction to MLTT, function-extensionality axiom, the groupoid model of Hofmann and Streicher, Voevodsky’s axiom of univalence, homotopy n-types, higher inductive types, the fundamental group of the higher circle, relations between HoTT and constructive mathematics, relations between HoTT and CaT.</p>

<p><em>1. Homotopy Type Theory: A Gentle Introduction</em>: Monday, September 25th, 16:00, <a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=luogo&amp;id=29">Aula G (Ca’ Vignal 2)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) is, syntactically, Martin-Löf Type Theory
(MLTT) plus the axiom called “univalence”.
Hence, it is, at the same time, an abstract functional programming
language, a logical system, and a synthetic way to describe homotopy
spaces.
The seminar introduces the type system, focusing on the homotopy
interpretation, univalence, and higher inductive types, i.e., the main
novelties of HoTT with respect to MLTT.
The seminar aims at providing the fundamental ideas of HoTT to
mathematicians and computer scientists willing to understand what is
HoTT without the burden of a formal, in-depth presentation.</p>
<p><em>2. Homotopy Type Theory: Equality as Equality</em>: Tuesday, September 26th, 16:00, <a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=luogo&amp;id=31">Aula I (Ca’ Vignal 2)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
The seminar aims at discussing the logical properties of judgemental
and propositional equalities in HoTT. It shows the fundamental
reasoning techniques of HoTT, and a few small novel results.
Also, the material provides a critical view of the current stage of
development of the theory, showing to what extent a systematic
approach is needed.
This talk is intended for mathematicians and computer scientists
willing to see more of the formal and technical side of HoTT, and some
minimal
knowledge about type theories, algebraic topology, and constructive
mathematics is presumed.</p>
