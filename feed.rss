<p><em>1. Homotopy Type Theory: A Gentle Introduction</em>: Monday, September 25th, 16:00, <a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=luogo&amp;id=29">Aula G (Ca’ Vignal 2)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) is, syntactically, Martin-Löf Type Theory (MLTT) plus the axiom called “univalence”. Hence, it is, at the same time, an abstract functional programming language, a logical system, and a synthetic way to describe homotopy spaces. The seminar introduces the type system, focusing on the homotopy interpretation, univalence, and higher inductive types, i.e., the main novelties of HoTT with respect to MLTT. The seminar aims at providing the fundamental ideas of HoTT to mathematicians and computer scientists willing to understand what is HoTT without the burden of a formal, in-depth presentation.</p>
<p><em>2. Homotopy Type Theory: Equality as Equality</em>: Tuesday, September 26th, 16:00, <a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=luogo&amp;id=31">Aula I (Ca’ Vignal 2)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The seminar aims at discussing the logical properties of judgemental and propositional equalities in HoTT. It shows the fundamental reasoning techniques of HoTT, and a few small novel results. Also, the material provides a critical view of the current stage of development of the theory, showing to what extent a systematic approach is needed. This talk is intended for mathematicians and computer scientists willing to see more of the formal and technical side of HoTT, and some minimal knowledge about type theories, algebraic topology, and constructive mathematics is presumed.</p>

<p><em>Synthetic scheme theory: a simpler framework for algebraic geometry</em></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This talk has been postponed to a later date.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The modern framework for algebraic geometry put forward by Grothendieck and his school has been enormously successful, providing the basis for many deep cornerstone results of the subject. Not least, we owe to this basis the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. Despite these successes, Grothendieck himself expressed discontent with his framework, and especially in recent years, concerns about the limitations and technical difficulties of the modern theory of algebraic geometry arose.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>With the benefit of hindsight, now that the mathematical content of the then-revolutionary new approach to algebraic geometry is well-understood, we propose an update to the foundations of algebraic geometry, called synthetic scheme theory, built on three postulates. These postulates capture essential geometric properties and allow us to reason constructively, avoiding the use of transfinite principles and other highly abstract concepts. Our hope is that this approach will allow for a clearer and more intuitive expression of the central notions and insights of algebraic geometry, requiring less technical machinery, will facilitate integrated developments, and promote computer-assisted proofs in the subject.</p>
<p>Crucially, our approach rests on the greater axiomatic freedom provided by constructive mathematics: The three postulates are inconsistent with classical logic.</p>

<p>_Algebraic Representation of the Fixed-Point Closure of *-continuous Kleene Algebras_</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The theorem of Chomsky and Schützenberger says that each context-free language L over a finite alphabet X is the image of the intersection of a regular language R over X+Y and the context-free Dyck-language D over X+Y of strings with balanced brackets from Y under the bracket-erasing homomorphism from the monoid of strings over X+Y to that of strings over X.</p>
<p>Within Hopkins’ algebraization of formal language theory we show that the algebra C(X) of context-free languages over X has an isomorphic copy in a suitable tensor product of the algebra R(X) of regular languages over X with a quotient of R(Y) by a congruence describing bracket matches and mismatches. It follows that all context-free languages over X can be defined by regular(!) expressions over X+Y where the letters of X commute with the brackets of Y, thereby providing a substitute for a fixed-point-operator.</p>
<p>This generalizes the theorem of Chomsky and Schützenberger and leads to an algebraic representation of the fixed-point closure of *-continuous Kleene algebras.</p>

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Perhaps the most pressing are that the currently framework heavily relies on the axiom of choice and other classical principles–even though high-level reasoning in algebraic geometry is often constructive–and that the framework references and requires gadgets of little geometric significance, such as injective or flabby resolutions. These foundational issues block integrated developments of algorithms in algebraic geometry, hindering us from extracting certified algorithms directly from proofs, and render computer formalization of algebraic geometry particularly challenging.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<p><em>Quantificatori moltiplicativi, esponenziali e cut-elimination</em> (j.w.w. Carlo Nicolai e Mario Piazza)</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> L’aggiunta di un predicato di verità governato da regole ingenue conduce spesso a sistemi contraddittori. Un metodo per recuperare la consistenza consiste nell’adottare una logica priva di contrazione: questa strada è stata seguita - tra gli altri - da Grishin e Cantini. Successivamente un ulteriore approccio basato su quantificatori moltiplicativi è stato proposto da Zardini, ma il sistema si è rivelato inconsistente. Nel presente talk proponiamo un’analisi della logica dei quantificatori moltiplicativi. In primo luogo offriamo una presentazione consistente di un sistema con predicato di verità decitazionale con quantificatori additivi. In seguito mostriamo come gli esponenziali (! e ?) possano essere interpretati in modo corretto e fedele mediante l’uso dei quantificatori moltiplicativi. Infine proponiamo una dimostrazione sintattica di eliminazione del taglio per un calcolo con quantificatori moltiplicativi. L’analisi della strategia porterà alla luce la presenza di contrazione implicita nelle regole dei quantificatori.</p>

<p><em>Predicative theory of stably locally compact locales</em></p>
<p>We give a predicative presentation of stably locally compact locales, the class of locales which includes locally compact regular locales (e.g., localic reals) as its subclass. In our setting, a stably locally compact locale is presented as a quasi-proximity lattice, a quasi-bounded distributive lattice (distributive lattice without top) together with a certain idempotent relation on it. Using this structure, we construct a coreflection from the category of locally compact regular locales and cobounded maps to that of stably locally compact locales and perfect maps. The construction of this coreflection generalizes Dedekind’s construction of real numbers as pairs of a lower and an upper cut.</p>

<p><em>Reflexive combinatory algebras</em></p>
<p>We introduce the notion of reflexivity for combinatory algebras. Reflexivity can be thought of as an equational counterpart of the Meyer-Scott axiom of combinatory models, which indeed allows us to characterise an equationally definable counterpart of combinatory models. This new structure, called strongly reflexive combinatory algebra, admits a finite axiomatisation with seven closed equations, and the structure is shown to be exactly the retract of combinatory models. Lambda algebras can be characterised as strongly reflexive combinatory algebras which are stable.</p>
<p>This is a joint work with Marlou M. Gijzen and Tatsuji Kawai.</p>

<em>Two-level type theory</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>Homotopy type theory (HoTT) extends Martin-Löf type theory with the univalence axiom, which establishes a tight connection between types and homotopy spaces and allows to identify isomorphic objects. Univalence has very useful applications, but it has also drawbacks: properties that are not invariant under homotopy cannot be expressed internally. An important case is the concept of semisimplicial types, whose definition is so far elusive in HoTT. Two-level type theory (2LTT) is a formal theory which allows constructions that require access to non-homotopy-invariant notions. It is composed of two separate levels of types related by a conversion function that preserves context extensions; the outer level is Martin-Löf type theory plus the uniqueness of identity proofs, and the inner level is HoTT. In this talk we will discuss the consequences of univalence, and introduce 2LTT as a way to overcome some difficulties. Then, we will introduce the notion of model for this system, and define the syntactical category as a first step to prove an initiality result for the syntax of 2LTT. The last part of the talk is based on a joint work-in-progress with Benedikt Ahrens and Nicolai Kraus.</p>
<p>The seminar will be held on Zoom. In order to get access to the Zoom meeting, please contact <a href="http://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&amp;id=21404&amp;lang=en">Peter Schuster</a> or <a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&amp;id=40478">Giulio Fellin</a>.</p>

<em>Universal Algebra in UniMath</em> (joint work with Marco Maggesi and Cosimo Perini Brogi)</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>In this talk we will report on recent experiments in implementing the basic notions of universal algebra in the Unimath library. Unimath is a replacement of the standard library of the Coq proof assistant based on the univalent foundations of mathematics. Since the use of general higher order inductive types is forbidden in Unimath, a relevant part of this work has been the implementation of terms as lists of function symbols in such a way that the operations on terms are computable by the standard Coq evaluation mechanism.</p>

<em>Sheaf models and constructive mathematics</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>Sheaf models over sites, introduced by Grothendieck in algebraic geometry, are also important in the meta-theory of intuitionistic mathematics for showing that some properties are not valid constructively or for providing models of the notion of choice sequences. In this talk, I would like to explain another use of sheaf models in constructive mathematics, suggested by Joyal in 1975, which is to provide a way to build an algebraic closure of an arbitrary field.</p>

<em>The Yoneda Reduction of Polymorphic Types (joint work with Luca Tranchini)</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>We explore a family of type isomorphisms in System F whose validity corresponds, semantically, to some form of the Yoneda isomorphism from category theory. These isomorphisms hold under theories of equivalence stronger than βη-equivalence, like those induced by parametricity and dinaturality. Based on such isomorphisms, we investigate a rewriting over types, that we call Yoneda reduction, which can be used to eliminate quantifiers from a polymorphic type, replacing them with a combination of monomorphic type constructors. We then demonstrate some applications of this rewriting to problems like counting the inhabitants of a type or characterizing program equivalence in some fragments of System F.</p>

<em>FULL CUT ELIMINATION AND INTERPOLATION FOR INTUITIONISTIC LOGIC WITH EXISTENCE PREDICATE</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>In previous work by Baaz and Iemhoff, a Gentzen calculus for intuitionistic logic with existence predicate is presented that satisfies partial cut elimination and Craig’s interpolation property; it is also conjectured that interpolation fails for the implication-free fragment. In this paper an equivalent calculus is introduced that satisfies full cut elimination and allows a direct proof of interpolation via Maehara’s lemma. In this way, it is possible to obtain much simpler interpolants and to better understand and (partly) overcome the failure of interpolation for the implication-free fragment.</p>
