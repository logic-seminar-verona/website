<em>Category theory and point-free topology</em></p>
<p>“Point-free topology” is the theory of “locales”. They are a type of spaces, very similar to topological spaces, except that they might not have an underlying set of points. Locales that have enough points are the same as topological spaces, but some locales have no points and are completely new objects. We will see how many notions and constructions of ordinary topology carry over to locales. Later in the course I will talk about the internal logic of categories of sheaves, which provide an extremely powerful tool to work with locales. I will explain how these mysterious “spaces without points” are closely connected to ‘forcing’ in set theory, as well as the strong connection between the the theory of locales and intuitionistic mathematics. The course will start with a basic introduction to category theory, including limits and co-limits, epi and monomorphisms, adjoint functors and adjoint functor theorem, etc. The theory of locales will give many illustrations and interesting example of these concepts.</p>

<em>Doctrines in categorical logic and the existential completion</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> The notion of hyperdoctrine was introduced by F.W. Lawvere in a series of seminal papers to synthesize the structural properties of logical systems. His crucial intuition was to consider logical languages and theories as indexed categories and to study their 2-categorical properties. For instance, connectives and quantifiers are determined by adjunctions. In this seminar we introduce the notions of primary and existential doctrine, which generalize that of hyperdoctrine, and we present the existential completion. In particular we show how we can add left adjoints along certain functors to a primary doctrine obtaining an existential doctrine. Moreover we show that the 2-monad obtained from this free construction is lax-idempotent, and that the 2-category of existential doctrines is isomorphic to the 2-category of algebras for this 2-monad. Finally we extend the notion of exact completion of an elementary existential doctrine to an arbitrary elementary doctrine.</p>

<em>On Directed Colimits of Hilbert Spaces</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> We will show that the category of Hilbert spaces and contractions has directed colimits, and that tensoring preserves them. We will also discuss (problems with) the generalization to bounded maps.</p>

<em>A simpler semantics for a large fragment of Homotopy Type Theory</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> The standard homotopical interpretation for homotopy type theory is deep and useful, but it sounds odd that the full power of higher-order category theory is needed to describe what is a piece "computable’’ mathematics. We show that those complex categorical tools are not necessary, by proposing a novel semantics, based on 1-category theory, for a big fragment of homotopy type theory which contains the whole Martin-Löf type theory and some higher inductive types. We also describe some proof theoretic results for this system; in particular, we prove a normalisation theorem, extending Girard’s reducibility candidates technique.</p>

<em>Solving and Proof Complexity for SAT and QBF</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> SAT and QBF solvers have become ubiquitous tools for the solution of hard computational problems from almost all application domains. In this talk we explain the underlying algorithmic principles of solving, both for propositional satisfiability (SAT) and for the more complex case of quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). Particular emphasis will be placed on how these solving approaches can be modelled proof theoretically and which techniques are available to evaluate their proof complexity.</p>
<p><em>Bio:</em> Since 2018 Olaf Beyersdorff is Professor of Theoretical Computer Science at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. His research interests are in algorithms, complexity, computational logic, and in particular proof complexity. Before coming to Jena he spent six years at the University of Leeds, as Professor of Computational Logic (2017–18), Associate Professor (2015–17), and Lecturer (2012–15). Since 2018 he is a visiting professor at the University of Leeds. Before that he was a visiting professor (2011/12) and visiting researcher (2009/10) at Sapienza University Rome, Lecturer at Leibniz University Hanover (2007–12) and postdoc at Humboldt University Berlin (2006/07). Beyersdorff obtained a PhD from Humboldt University Berlin in 2006 and completed the habilitation at Leibniz University Hanover in 2011.</p>

<em>Graph Theory and the Transfinite</em></p>
<p>A bit more than a 100 years ago, as a response to the foundational crisis in mathematics, Hermann Weyl published his “Das Kontinuum” in which he tried to rebuild mathematics from a stance that assumes the existence of the set of natural numbers as an actual completed infinity but no higher infinities. Much later in the 1970s, logicians began to systematically scour various chunks of ordinary mathematics to determine the existential commitments to the infinite that they required. This is known as “Reverse Mathematics”. To put it roughly, it turned out that most of “ordinary” mathematics didn’t need more than what Weyl had assumed. However, there are some notable exceptions. In particular graph theory sports some very nice theorems that require more of the transfinite. The talk will discuss some famous theorems and their relationships with the infinite world.</p>

<em>Empirical Negation and Beth Semantics</em></p>
<p>The negation in intuitionistic logic has a ‘future-oriented’ character, as elucidated by the valuation in Kripke models. Its application in mathematical contexts has been validated by the success of constructive mathematics. Its applicability in non-mathematical contexts, in contrast, is argued to have some problems. The existence of a different, ‘empirical’ notion of negation within the framework of intuitionistic logic has been discussed by Heyting, Dummett and others. De (2013) proposed empirical negation as falsity at the bottom root of a Kripke model, and De and Omori (2014) gave the axiomatisation of this logic.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will discuss how the choice of semantics in formulating empirical negation affects the logic one obtains, with Beth semantics as a particular example. This is followed by an examination of arithmetic with empirical negation.</p>

        <p><strong>Proof interpretations: A modern perspective</strong><br />
<a href="https://www2.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~powell/">Thomas Powell</a> (Technische Universität Darmstadt)</p>
<p>The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to proof interpretations and program extraction, up to the point where some of their applications in modern mathematics and computer science can be understood. I begin in the first lecture with a broad historical overview, tracing the origins of Gödel’s functional interpretation in Hilbert’s program and the early days of proof theory. The second and third lectures comprise an introduction to the extraction of computational content from proofs, both in the intuitionistic and classical setting. I conclude with a high level overview of the proof mining program, and present some recent applications of program extraction in functional analysis.</p>

<p>The lecture on Wednesday will comprise a <a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=seminario&amp;id=4712&amp;idC=70&amp;lang=it">research seminar</a>:</p>
<p><strong>A new application of proof mining in the fixed point theory of uniformly convex Banach spaces</strong></p>
<p>Proof mining is a branch of proof theory which makes use of proof theoretic techniques to extract quantitative information from seemingly nonconstructive proofs. In this talk, I present a new application of proof mining in functional analysis, which focuses on the convergence of Picard iterates for generalisations of nonexpansive mappings in uniformly convex Banach spaces.</p>
