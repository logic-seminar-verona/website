<em>A simpler semantics for a large fragment of Homotopy Type Theory</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> The standard homotopical interpretation for homotopy type theory is deep and useful, but it sounds odd that the full power of higher-order category theory is needed to describe what is a piece "computable’’ mathematics. We show that those complex categorical tools are not necessary, by proposing a novel semantics, based on 1-category theory, for a big fragment of homotopy type theory which contains the whole Martin-Löf type theory and some higher inductive types. We also describe some proof theoretic results for this system; in particular, we prove a normalisation theorem, extending Girard’s reducibility candidates technique.</p>

<em>Solving and Proof Complexity for SAT and QBF</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> SAT and QBF solvers have become ubiquitous tools for the solution of hard computational problems from almost all application domains. In this talk we explain the underlying algorithmic principles of solving, both for propositional satisfiability (SAT) and for the more complex case of quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). Particular emphasis will be placed on how these solving approaches can be modelled proof theoretically and which techniques are available to evaluate their proof complexity.</p>
<p><em>Bio:</em> Since 2018 Olaf Beyersdorff is Professor of Theoretical Computer Science at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. His research interests are in algorithms, complexity, computational logic, and in particular proof complexity. Before coming to Jena he spent six years at the University of Leeds, as Professor of Computational Logic (2017–18), Associate Professor (2015–17), and Lecturer (2012–15). Since 2018 he is a visiting professor at the University of Leeds. Before that he was a visiting professor (2011/12) and visiting researcher (2009/10) at Sapienza University Rome, Lecturer at Leibniz University Hanover (2007–12) and postdoc at Humboldt University Berlin (2006/07). Beyersdorff obtained a PhD from Humboldt University Berlin in 2006 and completed the habilitation at Leibniz University Hanover in 2011.</p>

<em>Graph Theory and the Transfinite</em></p>
<p>A bit more than a 100 years ago, as a response to the foundational crisis in mathematics, Hermann Weyl published his “Das Kontinuum” in which he tried to rebuild mathematics from a stance that assumes the existence of the set of natural numbers as an actual completed infinity but no higher infinities. Much later in the 1970s, logicians began to systematically scour various chunks of ordinary mathematics to determine the existential commitments to the infinite that they required. This is known as “Reverse Mathematics”. To put it roughly, it turned out that most of “ordinary” mathematics didn’t need more than what Weyl had assumed. However, there are some notable exceptions. In particular graph theory sports some very nice theorems that require more of the transfinite. The talk will discuss some famous theorems and their relationships with the infinite world.</p>

<em>Empirical Negation and Beth Semantics</em></p>
<p>The negation in intuitionistic logic has a ‘future-oriented’ character, as elucidated by the valuation in Kripke models. Its application in mathematical contexts has been validated by the success of constructive mathematics. Its applicability in non-mathematical contexts, in contrast, is argued to have some problems. The existence of a different, ‘empirical’ notion of negation within the framework of intuitionistic logic has been discussed by Heyting, Dummett and others. De (2013) proposed empirical negation as falsity at the bottom root of a Kripke model, and De and Omori (2014) gave the axiomatisation of this logic.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will discuss how the choice of semantics in formulating empirical negation affects the logic one obtains, with Beth semantics as a particular example. This is followed by an examination of arithmetic with empirical negation.</p>

        <p><strong>Proof interpretations: A modern perspective</strong><br />
<a href="https://www2.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~powell/">Thomas Powell</a> (Technische Universität Darmstadt)</p>
<p>The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to proof interpretations and program extraction, up to the point where some of their applications in modern mathematics and computer science can be understood. I begin in the first lecture with a broad historical overview, tracing the origins of Gödel’s functional interpretation in Hilbert’s program and the early days of proof theory. The second and third lectures comprise an introduction to the extraction of computational content from proofs, both in the intuitionistic and classical setting. I conclude with a high level overview of the proof mining program, and present some recent applications of program extraction in functional analysis.</p>

<p>The lecture on Wednesday will comprise a <a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=seminario&amp;id=4712&amp;idC=70&amp;lang=it">research seminar</a>:</p>
<p><strong>A new application of proof mining in the fixed point theory of uniformly convex Banach spaces</strong></p>
<p>Proof mining is a branch of proof theory which makes use of proof theoretic techniques to extract quantitative information from seemingly nonconstructive proofs. In this talk, I present a new application of proof mining in functional analysis, which focuses on the convergence of Picard iterates for generalisations of nonexpansive mappings in uniformly convex Banach spaces.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0RlNEI2Owk">Ranges of functors and elementary classes via topos theory</a></em></p>
<p>Given first order theories S,T and a functor F:Mod(S) –&gt;Mod(T) between their categories of models, one can ask whether objects in the range of F satisfy first-order sentences other than those of T, and whether the essential image of F is an elementary class. Under certain conditions on F we can give criteria for this for so-called k-geometric first-order sentences and k-geometric elementary classes.</p>
<p>These criteria are obtained by considering classifying toposes associated to S and T, such that F is induced by a geometric morphism between them, and then factorizing this geometric morphism appropriately. The involved notions will be explained and examples will be given.</p>

<p><a href="https://physicalsciences.leeds.ac.uk/pgr/1131/david-natingga-toth">Dávid Natingga</a> (University of Leeds) <em>Introduction to α-Computability Theory</em></p>
<p>An ordinal α is admissible iff the α-th level Lα of Gödel’s constructible hierarchy satisfies the axioms of Kripke-Platek set theory (roughly predicative part of ZFC).</p>
<p>α-computability theory is the study of the first-order definability theory over Gödel’s Lα for an admissible ordinal α.</p>
<p>Equivalently, α-computability theory studies the computability on a Turing machine with a transfinite tape and time of an order type α for an admissible ordinal α.</p>
<p>The field of α-computability theory is the source of deep connections between computability theory, set theory, model theory, definability theory and other areas of mathematics.</p>

<em>A logic for quantum register measurements</em><br />
(joint work with Andrea Masini)</p>
<p>We know that quantum logics are the most prominent logical systems associated to the lattices of closed Hilbert subspaces. But what happens if, following a quantum computing perspective, we want to associate a logic to the process of quantum registers measurements? This paper gives an answer to that question, and, quite surprisingly, shows that such a logic is nothing else but the standard propositional intuitionistic logic.</p>

<em>New reduction techniques in commutative algebra driven by logical methods</em></p>
<p>We present a new reduction technique which proposes the following trade-off: If we agree to restrict to constructive reasoning, then we may assume without loss of generality that a given reduced ring is Noetherian and in fact a field, thereby reducing to one of the easiest situations in commutative algebra.</p>
<p>This technique is implemented by constructing a suitable sheaf model and cannot be mimicked by classical reduction techniques. It has applications both in constructive algebra, for mining classical proofs for constructive content, and in classical algebra, where it has been used to substantially simplify the 50-year-old proof of Grothendieck’s generic freeness lemma.</p>
