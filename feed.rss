<em>Sheaf models and constructive mathematics</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>Sheaf models over sites, introduced by Grothendieck in algebraic geometry, are also important in the meta-theory of intuitionistic mathematics for showing that some properties are not valid constructively or for providing models of the notion of choice sequences. In this talk, I would like to explain another use of sheaf models in constructive mathematics, suggested by Joyal in 1975, which is to provide a way to build an algebraic closure of an arbitrary field.</p>
<p>The seminar will be held on Zoom. In order to get access to the Zoom meeting, please contact <a href="http://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&amp;id=21404&amp;lang=en">Peter Schuster</a> or <a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&amp;id=40478">Giulio Fellin</a>.</p>

<em>The Yoneda Reduction of Polymorphic Types (joint work with Luca Tranchini)</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>We explore a family of type isomorphisms in System F whose validity corresponds, semantically, to some form of the Yoneda isomorphism from category theory. These isomorphisms hold under theories of equivalence stronger than βη-equivalence, like those induced by parametricity and dinaturality. Based on such isomorphisms, we investigate a rewriting over types, that we call Yoneda reduction, which can be used to eliminate quantifiers from a polymorphic type, replacing them with a combination of monomorphic type constructors. We then demonstrate some applications of this rewriting to problems like counting the inhabitants of a type or characterizing program equivalence in some fragments of System F.</p>

<em>FULL CUT ELIMINATION AND INTERPOLATION FOR INTUITIONISTIC LOGIC WITH EXISTENCE PREDICATE</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>In previous work by Baaz and Iemhoff, a Gentzen calculus for intuitionistic logic with existence predicate is presented that satisfies partial cut elimination and Craig’s interpolation property; it is also conjectured that interpolation fails for the implication-free fragment. In this paper an equivalent calculus is introduced that satisfies full cut elimination and allows a direct proof of interpolation via Maehara’s lemma. In this way, it is possible to obtain much simpler interpolants and to better understand and (partly) overcome the failure of interpolation for the implication-free fragment.</p>

<p>The minicourse “Modal logics and intuitionistic logic” (12h) has been videoregistered in August 2020. Members of the University of Verona who wish to follow the course but are not authorised to access <a href="https://moodledidattica.univr.it/course/view.php?id=4217#section-4">this link</a> are kindly asked to contact <a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&amp;id=40478&amp;lang=it">Giulio Fellin</a>.</p>
<p><em>Abstract</em><br />
Modal logics capture concepts of necessity and possibility; intuitionistic logic models computation and construction. This minicourse is intended to introduce into both kinds of logic with particular attention on their interaction, from the angles of syntax and semantics but with a certain proof-theoretic flavour. One highlight will be Gödel’s embedding of intuitionistic propositional logic into the modal logic S4, which stood at the beginning of provability logic.</p>

        <p><strong>The dynamical method in commutative algebra</strong><br />
Ihsen Yengui (Univ. Sfax, Tunisia)</p>
<p>The minicourse “The dynamical method in commutative algebra” (12h) has been videoregistered in August 2020. Members of the University of Verona who wish to follow the course but are not authorised to access <a href="https://moodledidattica.univr.it/mod/page/view.php?id=168536">this link</a> are kindly asked to contact <a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&amp;id=40478&amp;lang=it">Giulio Fellin</a>.</p>
<p><em>Abstract</em><br />
Transfinite methods, typically in the form of a variant of Zorn’s Lemma, are frequently invoked during proofs in commutative algebra. Dynamical methods have proved practicable to still render constructive proofs of that kind. Roughly speaking, ideal objects such as prime ideals are approximated by paths in finite trees which are grown as the proofs in question demand and carry the information required for the desired computation.</p>

<em>Elementary doctrines as coalgebras</em> (j.w.w. Fabio Pasquali and Pino Rosolini)</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>Lawvere’s hyperdoctrines mark the beginning of applications of category theory to logic. The connection between (typed) logical theories and certain functors taking values in the category of posets is exemplified by two embeddings: of elementary doctrines into primary ones, and of elementary doctrines with effective quotients into elementary ones. In logical terms these correspond to the inclusion of <span class="math inline"><em>Λ</em><sub>=</sub></span>-theories into <span class="math inline"><em>Λ</em></span>-theories, resp. of <span class="math inline"><em>Λ</em><sub>=</sub></span>-theories with quotients into <span class="math inline"><em>Λ</em><sub>=</sub></span>-theories. Each of the two inclusions is part of an adjunction whose right, resp. left, functor adds quotients for equivalence relations. After discussing the above adjunctions and their connection to logic and type theory, I shall present a recent result, obtained with Fabio Pasquali and Pino Rosolini, showing that the first embedding is 2-comonadic. Finally, if time allows, I shall delve into the connections to model theory and discuss how the comonadic adjuntion provides an algebraic description of Shelah’s construction of a theory that eliminates imaginaries from classical model theory. The talk is based on the paper E., Pasquali, Rosolini. Elementary doctrines as coalgebras. J. Pure Appl. Algebra 224, 2020. doi:10.1016/j.jpaa.2020.106445</p>

<a href="http://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&amp;id=126&amp;lang=it">Andrea Masini</a> (Università di Verona)</p>
<p><em>Program</em><br />
1) Recalls of natural deduction (classical and intuitionist) and of typed lambda calculus.<br />
2) Examples of simple proofs in Coq (Goal, Assumptions and Tactics).<br />
3) Functional programming in CoQ.<br />
4) Structured data types.<br />
5) Polymorphism and higher order functions.<br />
6) The basic tactics.<br />
7) Logic in CoQ.<br />
8) Induction</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in a course of only 12 hours, even if intensive, it will not be possible to tackle the applications of COQ, which range from the specification and proof of properties of complex computer systems (SW and HW) to the mechanisation of mathematics (continuous and discrete).</p>
<p><em>Timetable</em><br />
Wednesday 9 September 2020, at [10.00-13.00]<br />
Thursday 10 September 2020, at [10.00-13.00]<br />
Wednesday 16 September 2020, at [10.00-13.00]<br />
Thursday 17 September 2020, at [10.00-13.00]</p>
<p>The course is open to everyone, the only pre-requisite is to have the basic knowledge of logic.</p>
<p>It is still not clear whether the course will be held in presence or on-line. We’re waiting for precise indications from the doctoral school.</p>

<em>Hilbert <span class="math inline"><em>ϵ</em></span>-operator and existence property in categorical logic</em> (j.w.w. M. Zorzi and M.E. Maietti)</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>In this talk we present some choice principles in the context of categorical logic and their applications in logic. In particular we focus on the existence property, the choice rule and the Hilbert <span class="math inline"><em>ϵ</em></span>-operator. We use the language of doctrines and the existential completion to present these principles and their characterization. Then we provide some direct applications in a fragment of intuitionistic logic.</p>

<em>Relational sequent calculus for Bi-Intuitionistic Linear Logic</em> (j.w.w. W. Heijltjes)</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> The relational sequent calculus for BILL used in [Bellin &amp; Heijltjes, {Proof nets for bi-intuitionistic linear logic}, FSCD 2018] is unsound. The problem extends to Hyland and De Paiva Full Iintuitionistic Linear Logic FILL 1993, but only to the treatment of the unit <span class="math inline">⊥</span>, as shown by an example of failure of interpolation in the sequent calculus, which yields unsoundness with respect to Hyland and De Paiva’s categorical semantics. We revise the sequent calculus, sketch the proof of interpolation and of cut elimination for it.</p>

<em>Proof-terms for dual-intuitionistic logic and refutation-terms for intuitionistic logic</em> (j.w.w. Gianluigi Bellin)</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>In the present paper, we present a term-assignment for the fragment of bi-intuitionistic logic whose only type-forming operation is the dual of intuitionistic implication. Typing judgements have the form <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> : <em>C</em> ⊢ <em>t</em><sub>1</sub> : <em>A</em><sub>1</sub>, ..., <em>t</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> : <em>A</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> i.e. a set of terms is typed by declaring a single variable (somewhat dualizing the simply typed λ-calculus, where a single term is typed declaring a set of variables). The main distinguishing feature of our term calculus is its distributed nature: whereas in the λμ-calculus all conclusions but one are μ-variables, in our calculus the computational content is distributed among the conclusions, i.e. to each conclusion one assigns a possibly complex term; moreover, reduction is also distributed, in the sense that the reduction acts globally on a set of terms, and not on a single one. The duality between our calculus and the simply typed λ-calculus suggests the possibility to use it not only to encode the dual-intuitionistic notion of provability, but an intuitionistic notion of refutability as well. We spell out this idea by using our terms to decorate Prawitz’s rules of intuitionistic natural deduction from the bottom to the top, thereby expressing a backwards reading of intuitionistic rules: given refutations of the conclusions one computes refutations of the premises.</p>
