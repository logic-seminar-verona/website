<em>Compositional theories for embedded programming</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<p>Embedded programming style allows to split the syntax in two parts, representing respectively a host language H and a core language C embedded in H. This formally models several situations in which a user writes code in a main language and delegates some tasks to an ad hoc domain specific language. Moreover, as showed in recent years, a particular case of the host-core approach allows a flexible management of data linearity, which is particularly useful in non-classical computational paradigms such as quantum computing.<br />
The definition of a systematised type theory to capture and standardize common properties of embedded languages is partially unexplored. We present a flexible fragment of such a type theory, together with its semantics in terms of enriched categories.<br />
We introduce the calculus HC0 and we use the notion of internal language of a category to relate the language to the class of its models, showing the equivalence between the category of models and the one of theories. This provides a stronger result w.r.t. standard soundness and completeness since it involves not only the models but also morphisms between models. We observe that the definition of the morphisms between models highlights further advantages of the embedded languages and we discuss some concrete instances, extensions and specializations of the syntax and the semantics.</p>
<p>The seminar will be held on Zoom. In order to get access to the Zoom meeting, please contact <a href="http://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&amp;id=21404&amp;lang=en">Peter Schuster</a>.</p>

<em>Logic in Railway Verification</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract</em>: Mathematical methods always played an important role in the verification of Railway control systems. In this talk we present two different approaches, the first for discrete systems, the second for hybrid systems. Both were used in our collaboration with Industry. We start with traditional solid state Railway interlockings, often specified using a graphical language called Ladder Logic. We give a semantics for this language and show how to get from aladder logic specification to a satisfiability problem. This process has been automated, and several existing Interlocking case studies, provided by our Industrial partner Siemens Rail Automation, have been verified using automated theorem proving tools. We further applied our own SAT solver, which we extracted from a formal constructive proof of the completeness of the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) proof system. The extracted SAT solver is a verified algorithm, which either yields a model or a DPLL refutation of a given clause set [1]. In the second part, we present our modelling of the European Rail Traffic Management System ERTMS, a state-of-the-art train control system, which aims at improving the performance/capacity of rail traffic systems, without compromising their safety. It generalizes from traditional interlockings to a system that includes on-board equipment and communication between trains and interlockings via radio block processors. Whilst the correctness of discrete interlocking systems is well-researched, it is challenging to verify ERTMS based systems for safety properties such as collision freedom due to the involvement of continuous data. The modelling and verification is done in Real-Time Maude, a tool that allows for both simulation and verification of real-time and hybrid systems [2].</p>

<em>Modal Logic for Induction</em> (j.w.w. Sara Negri and Peter Schuster)</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> We use modal logic to obtain syntactical, proof-theoretic versions of transfinite induction as axioms or rules within an appropriate labelled sequent calculus. While transfinite induction proper, also known as Noetherian induction, can be represented by a rule, the variant in which induction is done up to an arbitrary but fixed level happens to correspond to the Gödel–Löb axiom of provability logic. To verify the practicability of our approach in actual practice, we give a fairly universal pattern for proof transformation and test its use in several cases. Among other things, we give a direct and elementary syntactical proof of the theorem that the Gödel–Löb axiom characterises precisely the well-founded and transitive Kripke frames.</p>

        <p><strong>ATTENTION! The compact course below was canceled</strong></p>
<p>The course will take place on March 9-27, 2020. Timetable below.</p>
<p><strong>Category theory and point-free topology</strong></p>
<p>The Compact Course “Category Theory and Point-Free Topology” is primarily aimed at both undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students in mathematics with an interest in the intersection between logic, algebra and topology. The event will take place at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Verona, located in Strada le Grazie 15, Verona (Italy).</p>
<p><strong>Lecturer</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.normalesup.org/~henry/">Simon Henry</a> (University of Ottawa)</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
“Point-free topology” is the theory of “locales”. They are a type of spaces, very similar to topological spaces, except that they might not have an underlying set of points. Locales that have enough points are the same as topological spaces, but some locales have no points and are completely new objects. We will see how many notions and constructions of ordinary topology carry over to locales. Later in the course I will talk about the internal logic of categories of sheaves, which provide an extremely powerful tool to work with locales. I will explain how these mysterious “spaces without points” are closely connected to ‘forcing’ in set theory, as well as the strong connection between the the theory of locales and intuitionistic mathematics. The course will start with a basic introduction to category theory, including limits and co-limits, epi and monomorphisms, adjoint functors and adjoint functor theorem, etc. The theory of locales will give many illustrations and interesting example of these concepts.</p>

<em>Doctrines in categorical logic and the existential completion</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> The notion of hyperdoctrine was introduced by F.W. Lawvere in a series of seminal papers to synthesize the structural properties of logical systems. His crucial intuition was to consider logical languages and theories as indexed categories and to study their 2-categorical properties. For instance, connectives and quantifiers are determined by adjunctions. In this seminar we introduce the notions of primary and existential doctrine, which generalize that of hyperdoctrine, and we present the existential completion. In particular we show how we can add left adjoints along certain functors to a primary doctrine obtaining an existential doctrine. Moreover we show that the 2-monad obtained from this free construction is lax-idempotent, and that the 2-category of existential doctrines is isomorphic to the 2-category of algebras for this 2-monad. Finally we extend the notion of exact completion of an elementary existential doctrine to an arbitrary elementary doctrine.</p>

<em>On Directed Colimits of Hilbert Spaces</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> We will show that the category of Hilbert spaces and contractions has directed colimits, and that tensoring preserves them. We will also discuss (problems with) the generalization to bounded maps.</p>

<em>A simpler semantics for a large fragment of Homotopy Type Theory</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> The standard homotopical interpretation for homotopy type theory is deep and useful, but it sounds odd that the full power of higher-order category theory is needed to describe what is a piece "computable’’ mathematics. We show that those complex categorical tools are not necessary, by proposing a novel semantics, based on 1-category theory, for a big fragment of homotopy type theory which contains the whole Martin-Löf type theory and some higher inductive types. We also describe some proof theoretic results for this system; in particular, we prove a normalisation theorem, extending Girard’s reducibility candidates technique.</p>

<em>Solving and Proof Complexity for SAT and QBF</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> SAT and QBF solvers have become ubiquitous tools for the solution of hard computational problems from almost all application domains. In this talk we explain the underlying algorithmic principles of solving, both for propositional satisfiability (SAT) and for the more complex case of quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). Particular emphasis will be placed on how these solving approaches can be modelled proof theoretically and which techniques are available to evaluate their proof complexity.</p>
<p><em>Bio:</em> Since 2018 Olaf Beyersdorff is Professor of Theoretical Computer Science at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. His research interests are in algorithms, complexity, computational logic, and in particular proof complexity. Before coming to Jena he spent six years at the University of Leeds, as Professor of Computational Logic (2017–18), Associate Professor (2015–17), and Lecturer (2012–15). Since 2018 he is a visiting professor at the University of Leeds. Before that he was a visiting professor (2011/12) and visiting researcher (2009/10) at Sapienza University Rome, Lecturer at Leibniz University Hanover (2007–12) and postdoc at Humboldt University Berlin (2006/07). Beyersdorff obtained a PhD from Humboldt University Berlin in 2006 and completed the habilitation at Leibniz University Hanover in 2011.</p>
