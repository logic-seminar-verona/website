<em>Logic in Railway Verification</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract</em>: Mathematical methods always played an important role in the verification of Railway control systems. In this talk we present two different approaches, the first for discrete systems, the second for hybrid systems. Both were used in our collaboration with Industry. We start with traditional solid state Railway interlockings, often specified using a graphical language called Ladder Logic. We give a semantics for this language and show how to get from aladder logic specification to a satisfiability problem. This process has been automated, and several existing Interlocking case studies, provided by our Industrial partner Siemens Rail Automation, have been verified using automated theorem proving tools. We further applied our own SAT solver, which we extracted from a formal constructive proof of the completeness of the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) proof system. The extracted SAT solver is a verified algorithm, which either yields a model or a DPLL refutation of a given clause set [1]. In the second part, we present our modelling of the European Rail Traffic Management System ERTMS, a state-of-the-art train control system, which aims at improving the performance/capacity of rail traffic systems, without compromising their safety. It generalizes from traditional interlockings to a system that includes on-board equipment and communication between trains and interlockings via radio block processors. Whilst the correctness of discrete interlocking systems is well-researched, it is challenging to verify ERTMS based systems for safety properties such as collision freedom due to the involvement of continuous data. The modelling and verification is done in Real-Time Maude, a tool that allows for both simulation and verification of real-time and hybrid systems [2].</p>

<em>Modal Logic for Induction</em> (j.w.w. Sara Negri and Peter Schuster)</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> We use modal logic to obtain syntactical, proof-theoretic versions of transfinite induction as axioms or rules within an appropriate labelled sequent calculus. While transfinite induction proper, also known as Noetherian induction, can be represented by a rule, the variant in which induction is done up to an arbitrary but fixed level happens to correspond to the G√∂del‚ÄìL√∂b axiom of provability logic. To verify the practicability of our approach in actual practice, we give a fairly universal pattern for proof transformation and test its use in several cases. Among other things, we give a direct and elementary syntactical proof of the theorem that the G√∂del‚ÄìL√∂b axiom characterises precisely the well-founded and transitive Kripke frames.</p>

        <p><strong>ATTENTION! The compact course below was canceled</strong></p>
<p>The course will take place on March 9-27, 2020. Timetable below.</p>
<p><strong>Category theory and point-free topology</strong></p>
<p>The Compact Course ‚ÄúCategory Theory and Point-Free Topology‚Äù is primarily aimed at both undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students in mathematics with an interest in the intersection between logic, algebra and topology. The event will take place at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Verona, located in Strada le Grazie 15, Verona (Italy).</p>
<p><strong>Lecturer</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.normalesup.org/~henry/">Simon Henry</a> (University of Ottawa)</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
‚ÄúPoint-free topology‚Äù is the theory of ‚Äúlocales‚Äù. They are a type of spaces, very similar to topological spaces, except that they might not have an underlying set of points. Locales that have enough points are the same as topological spaces, but some locales have no points and are completely new objects. We will see how many notions and constructions of ordinary topology carry over to locales. Later in the course I will talk about the internal logic of categories of sheaves, which provide an extremely powerful tool to work with locales. I will explain how these mysterious ‚Äúspaces without points‚Äù are closely connected to ‚Äòforcing‚Äô in set theory, as well as the strong connection between the the theory of locales and intuitionistic mathematics. The course will start with a basic introduction to category theory, including limits and co-limits, epi and monomorphisms, adjoint functors and adjoint functor theorem, etc. The theory of locales will give many illustrations and interesting example of these concepts.</p>

<em>Doctrines in categorical logic and the existential completion</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> The notion of hyperdoctrine was introduced by F.W. Lawvere in a series of seminal papers to synthesize the structural properties of logical systems. His crucial intuition was to consider logical languages and theories as indexed categories and to study their 2-categorical properties. For instance, connectives and quantifiers are determined by adjunctions. In this seminar we introduce the notions of primary and existential doctrine, which generalize that of hyperdoctrine, and we present the existential completion. In particular we show how we can add left adjoints along certain functors to a primary doctrine obtaining an existential doctrine. Moreover we show that the 2-monad obtained from this free construction is lax-idempotent, and that the 2-category of existential doctrines is isomorphic to the 2-category of algebras for this 2-monad. Finally we extend the notion of exact completion of an elementary existential doctrine to an arbitrary elementary doctrine.</p>

<em>A simpler semantics for a large fragment of Homotopy Type Theory</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> The standard homotopical interpretation for homotopy type theory is deep and useful, but it sounds odd that the full power of higher-order category theory is needed to describe what is a piece "computable‚Äô‚Äô mathematics. We show that those complex categorical tools are not necessary, by proposing a novel semantics, based on 1-category theory, for a big fragment of homotopy type theory which contains the whole Martin-L√∂f type theory and some higher inductive types. We also describe some proof theoretic results for this system; in particular, we prove a normalisation theorem, extending Girard‚Äôs reducibility candidates technique.</p>

<em>Solving and Proof Complexity for SAT and QBF</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> SAT and QBF solvers have become ubiquitous tools for the solution of hard computational problems from almost all application domains. In this talk we explain the underlying algorithmic principles of solving, both for propositional satisfiability (SAT) and for the more complex case of quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). Particular emphasis will be placed on how these solving approaches can be modelled proof theoretically and which techniques are available to evaluate their proof complexity.</p>
<p><em>Bio:</em> Since 2018 Olaf Beyersdorff is Professor of Theoretical Computer Science at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. His research interests are in algorithms, complexity, computational logic, and in particular proof complexity. Before coming to Jena he spent six years at the University of Leeds, as Professor of Computational Logic (2017‚Äì18), Associate Professor (2015‚Äì17), and Lecturer (2012‚Äì15). Since 2018 he is a visiting professor at the University of Leeds. Before that he was a visiting professor (2011/12) and visiting researcher (2009/10) at Sapienza University Rome, Lecturer at Leibniz University Hanover (2007‚Äì12) and postdoc at Humboldt University Berlin (2006/07).

<em>Graph Theory and the Transfinite</em></p>
<p>A bit more than a 100 years ago, as a response to the foundational crisis in mathematics, Hermann Weyl published his ‚ÄúDas Kontinuum‚Äù in which he tried to rebuild mathematics from a stance that assumes the existence of the set of natural numbers as an actual completed infinity but no higher infinities. Much later in the 1970s, logicians began to systematically scour various chunks of ordinary mathematics to determine the existential commitments to the infinite that they required. This is known as ‚ÄúReverse Mathematics‚Äù. To put it roughly, it turned out that most of ‚Äúordinary‚Äù mathematics didn‚Äôt need more than what Weyl had assumed. However, there are some notable exceptions. In particular graph theory sports some very nice theorems that require more of the transfinite. The talk will discuss some famous theorems and their relationships with the infinite world.</p>

<em>Empirical Negation and Beth Semantics</em></p>
<p>The negation in intuitionistic logic has a ‚Äòfuture-oriented‚Äô character, as elucidated by the valuation in Kripke models. Its application in mathematical contexts has been validated by the success of constructive mathematics. Its applicability in non-mathematical contexts, in contrast, is argued to have some problems. The existence of a different, ‚Äòempirical‚Äô notion of negation within the framework of intuitionistic logic has been discussed by Heyting, Dummett and others. De (2013) proposed empirical negation as falsity at the bottom root of a Kripke model, and De and Omori (2014) gave the axiomatisation of this logic.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will discuss how the choice of semantics in formulating empirical negation affects the logic one obtains, with Beth semantics as a particular example. This is followed by an examination of arithmetic with empirical negation.</p>

        <p><strong>Proof interpretations: A modern perspective</strong><br />
<a href="https://www2.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~powell/">Thomas Powell</a> (Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt)</p>
<p>The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to proof interpretations and program extraction, up to the point where some of their applications in modern mathematics and computer science can be understood. I begin in the first lecture with a broad historical overview, tracing the origins of G√∂del‚Äôs functional interpretation in Hilbert‚Äôs program and the early days of proof theory. The second and third lectures comprise an introduction to the extraction of computational content from proofs, both in the intuitionistic and classical setting. I conclude with a high level overview of the proof mining program, and present some recent applications of program extraction in functional analysis.</p>

<p><strong>A new application of proof mining in the fixed point theory of uniformly convex Banach spaces</strong></p>
<p>Proof mining is a branch of proof theory which makes use of proof theoretic techniques to extract quantitative information from seemingly nonconstructive proofs. In this talk, I present a new application of proof mining in functional analysis, which focuses on the convergence of Picard iterates for generalisations of nonexpansive mappings in uniformly convex Banach spaces.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0RlNEI2Owk">Ranges of functors and elementary classes via topos theory</a></em></p>
<p>Given first order theories S,T and a functor F:Mod(S) ‚Äì&gt;Mod(T) between their categories of models, one can ask whether objects in the range of F satisfy¬†first-order sentences other than those of T, and whether the essential image of F is an elementary class. Under certain conditions on F we can give¬†criteria for this for so-called k-geometric first-order sentences and¬†k-geometric elementary classes.</p>
<p>These criteria are obtained by considering classifying toposes¬†associated to S and T, such that F is induced by a geometric¬†morphism between them, and then factorizing this geometric morphism¬†appropriately. The involved notions will be explained and examples will be given.</p>

<em>A logic for quantum register measurements</em><br />
(joint work with Andrea Masini)</p>
<p>We know that quantum logics are the most prominent logical systems associated to the lattices of closed Hilbert subspaces. But what happens if, following a quantum computing perspective, we want to associate a logic to the process of quantum registers measurements? This paper gives an answer to that question, and, quite surprisingly, shows that such a logic is nothing else but the standard propositional intuitionistic logic.</p>

<em>New reduction techniques in commutative algebra driven by logical methods</em></p>
<p>We present a new reduction technique which proposes the following trade-off: If we agree to restrict to constructive reasoning, then we may assume without loss of generality that a given reduced ring is Noetherian and in fact a field, thereby reducing to one of the easiest situations in commutative algebra.</p>
<p>This technique is implemented by constructing a suitable sheaf model and cannot be mimicked by classical reduction techniques. It has applications both in constructive algebra, for mining classical proofs for constructive content, and in classical algebra, where it has been used to substantially simplify the 50-year-old proof of Grothendieck‚Äôs generic freeness lemma.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=205666">Lorenzo Rossi</a></strong>¬†(Paris Lodron University of Salzburg) <strong><em>A unified approach to truth and implication¬†</em></strong></p>
<p>The truth predicate is commonly thought to be symmetric, at least in the sense that for every sentence <em>A</em>, <em>A</em> and¬†‚Äú<em>A</em> is true‚Äù should be inter-substitutable <em>salva veritate</em>. In this paper, we study an object-linguistic predicate for <em>implication</em>¬†obeying similar symmetry requirements.¬†While several non-classical logics are compatible with symmetric truth, theories of symmetric implication can only be formulated in a small class of substructural logics.¬†We present an axiomatic theory of symmetric implication and truth over Peano Arithmetic, called <strong>SyIT</strong>, formulated in a non-reflexive logic, and we study its semantics and proof-theory. First, we show that <strong>SyIT</strong> axiomatizes a class of fixed-point models that generalize Saul Kripke‚Äôs (1975) fixed points for symmetric truth. Second, we compare <strong>SyIT</strong> with the theory¬†<strong>PKF</strong>_¬†_(Halbach and Horsten 2006),¬†an axiomatization of Kripke‚Äôs fixed points for truth in strong Kleene logic, and we show that <strong>SyIT</strong> and <strong>PKF</strong> are proof-theoretically equivalent. The latter result shows that going substructural and adding a symmetric implication predicate to a theory of symmetric truth comes at no proof-theoretical costs.</p>
